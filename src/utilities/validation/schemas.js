4. The email() method validates if the value is an email. */

4. The email variable is assigned to the email object shape.

/* Here is the explanation for the code above:
1. The first line is a JavaScript module definition for the module.exports object.  This is a Node.js convention that allows other modules to access the functions in the module (authenticate, register, request, change, update).
2. The following lines are the function definitions for the functions in the module.  The authenticate function is the first function defined.  The authenticate function takes two parameters: username and password.  The function returns a Promise object that is resolved or rejected based on the result of the authentication.  The register function is the second function defined.  The register function takes two parameters: username and password.  The function returns a Promise object that is resolved or rejected based on the result of the registration.  The request function is the third function defined.  The request function takes one parameter: username.  The function returns a Promise object that is resolved or rejected based on the result of the request.  The change function is the fourth function defined.  The change function takes two parameters: username and password.  The function returns a Promise object that is resolved or rejected based on the result of the change.  The update function is the fifth function defined.  The update function takes two parameters: username and password.  The function returns a Promise object that is resolved or rejected based on the result of the update.
3. The last line in the file is a closing curly brace that closes the module.exports object. */
